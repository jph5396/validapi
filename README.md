# validapi

A REST api framework aimed at validating request body content before hitting the handler to provide more specific error messages to the client and clean up handler code. Originally from [MyAPI](https://github.com/jph5396/MyAPI). I am starting a new repo to with: 
- a custom router implementation
- a fluent interface
- smaller footprint
